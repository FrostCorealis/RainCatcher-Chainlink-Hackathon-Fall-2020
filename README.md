# RainCatcher

Designed by Storm Corealis, RainCatcher is blockchain game that incorporates Chainlink VRF, Keepers, and weather oracles. Players will mint a Bucket (a random SVG NFT), stake it on one of several city locations worldwide, and collect RAIN tokens when there is precipitation in that location. RAIN tokens will be used to water dynamic NFT plants in the Garden, and when plants are fully grown, they can be added to the Field, where players and visitors will be able wander and explore.

On 11.22.21, we connected our Bucket contract to the frontend, where Temporary Buckets can be minted! ðŸª£
