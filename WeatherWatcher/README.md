Weather Watcher uses Chainlink VRF to generate a SVG NFT that is completely on the blockchain. 🔗 

It's a truly random way to predict the weather. ⛈️ 🌪️ ☃️ 🌤️ 😎

While it's not the project we set out to create for the Hackathon, we're very excited to have Weather Watchers working.  

Looking ahead, creating a working random SVG project project opens many doors for us.  Once we get the image part sorted out, we'll be able to randomly generate buckets to use for RainCatcher.

HUGE thank you to https://github.com/SimRunBot for elegant and adaptable code, to Buildspace for giving us the tools we needed to tinker and experiment, and to Replit for the wonderfully user-friendly frontend development environment. 💻 ✨
