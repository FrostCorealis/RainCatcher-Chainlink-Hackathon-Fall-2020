While Weather Watcher is not the project we set out to create for the Hackathon, Weather Watcher is whimsical and fun, and we think it looks pretty good!  We're thrilled (and relieved!) to have it working.  This little project opened a world of possibilities for us and will evolve into one of the facets of the RainCatcher ecosystem.  

HUGE thank you to everyone at Chainlink for the opportunity (+ all the amazing workshops & detailed docs), to Buildspace for giving us the tools we need to tinker and experiment, to Replit for the wonderfully user-friendly frontend development environment, to Alchemy for connecting us to the world, and to https://github.com/SimRunBot for his elegant and adaptable functions. 💻 ✨
