Weather Watcher uses Chainlink VRF to generate a svg nft that is completely on the blockchain. 🔗 

It's a truly random way to predict the weather. ⛈️ 🌪️ ☃️ 🌤️

While it's not working perfectly quite yet, it's on the way, and soon it will be a working random svg project.  

Looking ahead, creating this project opens many doors for us.  Once we get the image part sorted out, we'll be able to randomly generate buckets to use for RainCatcher.
