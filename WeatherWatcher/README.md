Weather Watcher uses Chainlink VRF to generate a SVG NFT that is completely on the blockchain. 🔗 

It's a truly random way to predict the weather. ⛈️ 🌪️ ☃️ 🌤️

While it's not the project we set out to create, we're very excited to have Weather Watchers working.  

Looking ahead, creating a working random SVG project project opens many doors for us.  Once we get the image part sorted out, we'll be able to randomly generate buckets to use for RainCatcher.
